# Immunophage-synergy-in-vivo
MATLAB scripts for simulating an in vivo model of phage therapy in acute pneumonia by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The scripts generate figures in the paper: Roach & Leung et al., Synergy between the Host Immune System and Bacteriophage Is Essential for Successful Phage Therapy against an Acute Respiratory Pathogen, Cell Host & Microbe 22, 38 (2017).

Run Gen_all_figs.m to generate all the figures in the paper and supplementary.
The scripts are grouped according to their outputs into different directories:
1. lysis_rate: plotting phage lysis rates used in the linear, heterogeneous mixing (HM) and phage saturation model.
2. Sensitivity_analysis: results of sensitivity analysis on nonlinear phage killing rates
3. Time_series: time series of bacteria, phage and immune cell populations. Scripts of different variants of the models are further grouped into subdirectories.
